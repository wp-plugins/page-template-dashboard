An easy way to see which templates your pages are using without having to view the page editor.

== Description ==

Page Template Dashboard is a simple plugin that let's you easily survey which pages are using which templates without
having to load the page editor.

If no template is assigned, then the 'Default' template will be rendered; otherwise, the user-friendly name (rather than
the file name) will be displayed.

Finally, if the plugin will properly handle the case when a page has a template assigned to it from a previous theme that 
does not exist in the current theme

The plugin is also fully localized for translation.
